"""A client on another machine, attached to a shared store here: its hooks and MCP tools over HTTP.

Claude Code or Codex on that machine keeps no store.  Its hooks forward each payload here with the entry's
token (``remote_client``), and this server runs the handler a local client's hooks run, so the entry, its
grants and its capture scope are this machine's, fixed by the token and never by what the client sends.  A
Claude Code client reads its own session record there and sends what the record shows being said
(``transcript.said``): the record itself never leaves that machine.  The entry's MCP tools are served over
streamable HTTP at ``/mcp``.

Listen only on an address the client reaches privately, a tailnet one, and give each entry its own token.
This machine keeps the token's SHA-256 in ``<home>/scope-recall/remote-server.json``; the token itself
stays on the client's machine, where ``remote_client token`` made it.  ``serve`` runs without a console: each
hook, each refused request and the server's own errors go to ``remote-server.log`` beside the config.

    python -m scope_recall.adapters.codex.remote_server configure --home <home> --host claude-code \
        --listen 100.64.0.10 --port 18765 --token-sha256 <hex>
    python -m scope_recall.adapters.codex.remote_server serve --home <home> --host claude-code [--env-file <file>]
