"""See or stop an entry's resident prompt recall server (``adapters/clients/resident_entry``).

    scope-recall resident status --home <entry home> --host workbuddy
    scope-recall resident stop   --home <entry home> --host workbuddy

A resident server runs from the entry's package: stop it before a ``package-upgrade`` of that package, after the client
itself (a live MCP server of the client starts one again at its next look, every ``RESIDENT_KEEP_SECONDS``, once the
last start is a minute old).  It writes nothing, so stopping it loses nothing; the next prompt starts one again when
the client keeps one.  ``running`` says whether one holds the entry's lock; ``servers`` lists those whose process is
known.  One whose identity cannot be proven, where a process's start time cannot be read (macOS), is listed
``verified: false`` and never stopped: it ends itself within ``IDLE_CHECK_SECONDS`` once its package is replaced or its
minutes are 0 (``adapters/clients/resident_entry``).  A ``stop`` after which one still holds the lock says
``still_running`` and exits 1, so that an upgrade script does not go on.
