"""The memory skill says what the core enforces, and both hosts install it.

``scope-recall-memory`` tells an agent how to answer what is remembered about the user and what
correcting, muting or deleting a memory does.  The part that matters most is the part that can rot:
the words it says the user's message must contain are the core's own patterns, quoted.  If a pattern
changes, or the page is edited, an agent would coach the user into a request the core refuses, so
every quoted word is checked against the pattern it is quoted from.
