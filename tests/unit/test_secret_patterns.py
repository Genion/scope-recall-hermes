"""The secret scan treats an escaped line break as the boundary it is.

Once a source is serialised into a model request its line breaks become the
two characters ``\\n``, which are not whitespace, so an assignment pattern's
value ran on into the next line.  A document template with an empty
credential slot ("AppSecret:" and nothing after it) was clean as stored and
refused as ``sensitive_request`` in every request that carried it: 369
candidate evaluations on one instance, none of which held a secret.
