"""A group of embeddings is asked for, written and recorded as a group, claims included.

The pilot's rebuild of 32,000 imported embeddings measured where a pass spent its time.
Sources went a hundred to a request and one commit per group, yet a pass of five hundred
took thirty seconds and a pass of a thousand outlived its sixty-second lease: each member
was then recorded on its own in three transactions.  Claims were never grouped at all --
one request each, one after another, about two seconds a claim.  And members left to ask
for themselves were still asked after the lease they were claimed with had run out, their
vectors paid for and dropped as stale.
