"""The lexical index: a term dictionary and integer postings.

``lexical_projection`` stored every (term, event_id, source_revision) as
text, and its mirror index doubled that: on one instance 5.2 million rows
took 713 MB, half the store, for 258,000 distinct terms.  A term is now one
row in ``lexical_terms`` and a posting two integers in ``lexical_postings``
(``term_id``, ``source_id``) with a reverse index: 135 MB for the same rows,
and a document-frequency lookup in 18 ms.  ``source_id`` is a source
version's integer identity (``source_events.source_id``), assigned at insert;
the 1109 upgrade numbers the existing rows.

Every reader and writer of the index goes through here.  The two ranking
queries that start from the terms (``storage.search_sources`` and the lexical
channel in ``retrieval_storage``) splice in ``JOIN`` below, so the tables are
named in one place: filter on ``t.term``, aggregate on ``e``.  The preference
match in ``background_context`` starts from its few claims instead and names
the tables itself.
