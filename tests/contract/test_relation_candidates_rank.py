"""An object reached by relation never outranks a direct hit.

Expansion scored every related object by its place in its own seed's list, so the first
object related to the thirteenth hit scored 1/62: above every direct hit but the first.
Nothing showed it while an episode's lineage was copied onto each of its revisions,
because the rows of one episode at dozens of old revisions spent the relation bound
without becoming candidates.  Writing that lineage once freed the bound, the related
objects arrived, and over one instance's real questions the reply that had answered each
was in the top five for 20 of 30 where it had been for 28.  With a related object held
below the hit it was reached from it is 28 again, on the same stores, with fact recall,
no-match, supersession and question recall unchanged.  On a second instance the freed
bound had answered one question of 25 that 3.1.0 missed; weighing gives that one back, so
both instances recall what 3.1.0 recalled.
