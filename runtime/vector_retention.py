"""Expire the vectors of tool outputs older than the retention window.

Sits beside ``vector_upkeep.py``: ``runtime/instance.py`` has the single call
site, at the start of a drain, just before the compaction that reclaims what
a pass deleted.  The source text, its lexical index and everything derived
from it (claims, episodes, candidates) stay; only the vector goes.  An expired
tool output is still found by its words and through whatever cites it, never
again by meaning alone.  (A withheld output's placeholder has no words of its
own to be found by: ``core/events.indexed_terms``.)

Why tool outputs, and why a window: on a busy instance four in five captured
sources were tool output, each carrying a 12 KB vector -- the bulk of the
store's daily growth -- while a few hundred of 170,000 sources ever became
claim evidence.  A window keeps recent work fully searchable and lets the old
bulk go, at a pace the operator sets (``vector.tool_output_retention_days``).

Not responsible for: deciding what a tool output is (the source's ``role``),
the native delete (the store's ``delete_by_ids``), or reclaiming the space
(``vector_upkeep.compact_if_due``, which the drain runs next).
