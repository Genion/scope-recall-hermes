Over the benchmark's real questions, alpha answered 21 of 30 and beta 14 of 25: the
question itself came back, and its neighbours, but not the answer.  A reply is joined to
its question only through episode membership, which is spent on every event of the episode
in id order, so a question recalled at all could use the whole relation bound before
reaching what it was told.  The turn a person's message opened is followed first, for
