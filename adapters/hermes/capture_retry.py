"""What a busy store kept in memory for the Hermes adapter to write again.

A capture that met a busy store or ran out of time is kept, at most 16 at a time, and written again by a thread of
its own every ``_RETRY_EVERY_S`` while any is kept, at each turn's end, before a compression, at the session's end and
at shutdown; one kept longer than ``_RETRY_GIVE_UP_S`` is dropped and logged as lost.  It works on the adapter's
state under the adapter's lock (``self._adapter``) and writes through the adapter's capture."""
