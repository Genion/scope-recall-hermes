"""A pass that runs out of time hands back what it claimed and never touched, unspent.

Found on a live instance on 2026-09-21.  Its ``max_items`` had been raised to 1000 for a one-off drain
and never put back, so a pass claimed its whole embedding backlog as one group.  Every claim spends one
of an item's three attempts.  The worker does hand the rest of a group back unspent when a group is cut
short, but not when the reason was that the pass had no time left, which is the usual reason: the
items at the tail were leased, never looked at, and released by lease expiry with the attempt gone.
Three passes later they were failed as ``lease_exhausted``; the automatic recovery re-opened them into
the same oversized group four times; 888 embeddings ended ``auto_retry:4|lease_exhausted`` in an hour
without one of them ever having been sent to the provider.
