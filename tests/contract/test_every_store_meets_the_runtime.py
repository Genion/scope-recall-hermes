"""Every companion store can be asked what the runtime asks of a store.

The runtime reaches a vector store through two seams: ``LanceIndexWriter`` publishes through
``fenced_upsert_records(rows, guard=, remaining_seconds=)``, and ``LancePurgePort`` purges through
``purge_governed_members(..., remaining_seconds=)``.  ``build_vector_store`` picks the helper-process
store on Windows and the in-process one everywhere else, and every fence and purge test drove the
helper-process store, on Windows.  So three gaps shipped unseen:

- the in-process LanceDB store had no ``fenced_upsert_records``: on Linux every publication failed with
  ``fenced_upsert_unsupported`` and the index stayed empty (#99, reported from a production install);
- its ``purge_governed_members`` took ``budget_seconds``, the name the Windows helper uses, and refused
  the port's ``remaining_seconds`` with a ``TypeError`` the port reads as "not purged": a forget never
  finished there;
- the SQLite companion, publishable since #85, had no purge at all.

The first test asks each store class for the two calls by signature.  It needs no native code, so it
runs on every platform and in this tier, which forbids the child process and the socket LanceDB needs
to load.  The behaviour is written once, as the ``check_*`` functions below: this file runs them
against the SQLite companion, and ``tests/storage_native/test_in_process_lance_store.py`` runs them
against the in-process LanceDB store in the native tier.
