"""Operator commands for a shared store, the one store every agent attaches to.

``init-shared`` makes the store's directory and manifest.  ``attach`` makes a
host's home an entry of it, carrying over the grants the home's own
installation had, and writes the runtime configs: the entry's, and the shared
worker's.  ``detach`` undoes that for one home.  ``adopt`` records the store's
new directory after the directory was copied elsewhere.  ``entries`` lists who
is attached and when each was last heard from.  ``import-entry`` copies what
an entry's own store held, moved aside at attach, into the shared store
(``shared_import.py``).

The store's directory holds everything memory needs, so moving to another
machine is copying that directory, ``adopt``, and attaching each agent again.
Every write command keeps a copy of each file it replaces and leaves a receipt
under the store's ``receipts/``.  Hermes homes attach with the grants their own
installation had; a local client (Codex, Claude Code) has none of its own and
attaches as the owner, with grants taken from Hermes entries' owner rows.
