"""Re-judge stored claims after the rules that judged them have changed.

A claim is judged once, when it is written.  Nothing ever looks at it again, so
a gate repair only ever helps claims captured *after* the repair ships -- the
366 proposals already in one instance's store would keep their original verdicts
forever, including the ones refused by a rule that has since been fixed.

This is the bounded way to let a rule change reach them.  It re-runs exactly
the qualification an ordinary write runs, on the payload already stored, and
writes a new version only where the verdict actually differs.  It never
rewrites the assertion: if re-binding the subject would change what the claim
says, the claim is left alone and reported, because that is a different
mutation and belongs to a different, deliberate operation.

Deliberately an operator command rather than background work.  Re-qualification
is the consequence of a *code* change, and code changes are events somebody
decides on; on a timer it would spend forever re-deriving verdicts that have
already settled.  ``--dry-run`` exists because the first thing to do after a
gate change is look at the diff, not apply it.

Not responsible for: judging (``core/claims.qualify``), or persisting the page
cursor (the caller does, exactly as ``repair_frames`` does it).
