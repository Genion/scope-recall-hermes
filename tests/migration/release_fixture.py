"""Test-only builder for a store written by an earlier release's own code.

The child process imports a frozen release tree from ``git archive`` before
anything of the current package, exactly as ``legacy_fixture`` does for the
2.0 baseline, so the fixture carries what that release really wrote: ``v3.1.0``
wrote schema 1108, one copied lineage row per episode revision, its work queue;
``v3.1.2``, the release 3.2 users come from, wrote schema 1109.
Every fixture the older upgrade tests used was a fresh store downgraded by
hand, which is how a wrong version stamp in the 1107 step went unnoticed.
