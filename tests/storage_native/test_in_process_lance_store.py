"""The in-process LanceDB store can be published to and purged through the runtime's two seams.

This is the store every LanceDB install off Windows runs (``build_vector_store``), and until #99 it
could do neither: see ``tests/contract/test_every_store_meets_the_runtime.py``, which holds the
behaviour and runs it against the SQLite companion.  It is driven directly here rather than through
``build_vector_store``, which hands Windows the helper-process store, so that the in-process one is
exercised wherever this tier runs.  LanceDB needs a socket and a child process to load, which is why
these cases live in the native tier and not beside the others.
