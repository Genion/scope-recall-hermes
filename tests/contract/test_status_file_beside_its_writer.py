"""A status file is read and replaced beside another process without failing either one.

On Windows a file cannot be opened for the instant ``os.replace`` swaps it in, and cannot be
replaced while a reader holds it open; either side gets ``PermissionError``.  The supervisor reads
its control file outside the control lock, beside the wake that rewrites it, so now and then the
refusal ended a supervisor.  It was seen as a nightly CI failure: ``control.read()`` raised
``PermissionError: [Errno 13]`` in ``test_real_detached_supervisor_processes_future_local_work_after_host_exit``
while the real supervisor process was writing the same file.
