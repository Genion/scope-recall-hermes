"""A client's prompt recall server, a process of its own beside the client's (``local_endpoint.ensure_resident``).

WorkBuddy's agent (2.147.0) puts itself and every process it starts in a Windows job that ends them all with it, and
this server cannot leave that job: under WorkBuddy it lives as long as the conversation's agent process that started
it, or less (measured 2026-10-04; docs/install.md, section 12).

WorkBuddy starts the entry's MCP server, and with it the recall server its prompt hooks ask, with each conversation's
agent process and stops it with that process.  A prompt that started one met a server still opening its vector store
and its embedding connection, and was recalled by words alone: a cold server answered with its vector search 12.7 s
after its start (measured 2026-10-03), past the prompt hook's 6 s.  This server is started by the entry's hook or MCP
server when none runs, names itself resident (hooks ask it first), and ends ``resident_recall_minutes`` after the last
prompt's recall or the last mark of a live client process (``local_endpoint.keep_resident``), once the minutes are 0,
once its package on disk is replaced, or once a recall has been stuck for minutes.  One runs for each entry and
client: a second of the same version gives way to the first, and a prompt hook that finds one of another version stops
it, where it can prove and end it, and starts its own (``local_endpoint.ensure_resident``).  It writes nothing to the
store.
