#: Ceiling on the candidates hydrated after the deadline is already gone.
#:
#: An optional channel that overruns its allowance used to empty the packet:
#: the lexical, exact and recent candidates were all in hand, and the hydrate
#: loop abandoned every one of them because the clock was gone.  The floor is
#: the caller's own ``max_items`` rather than a fixed number, because hydrating
#: three when the packet holds eight just moves the emptiness one stage later.
#: This ceiling bounds what a large ``max_items`` can cost once the deadline is
#: gone -- each one is a single bounded storage read, and the overrun is still
#: reported, so nothing is hidden.
MINIMUM_HYDRATION_CAP = 16
#: Claims offered per round.  A packet holds at most 30 items and a default one
#: six; a claim that answers competes for those slots on rank, so a deep pool
#: of claims would only spend hydration on statements that cannot be shown.
CLAIM_CANDIDATES = 16
#: Share of its fusion score context-only evidence keeps in live modes: a bare
#: question, or a reply restating what a recall tool returned in its turn.
#: Asked again, one instance returned five earlier questions like the query ahead of
#: the reply that answered one, and another instance's recall test report came back ahead
#: of the evidence it quoted.  At 0.6 a first-ranked one falls below a reply that
#: ranked in the mid-teens, and still ranks as context when nothing answers.
CONTEXT_ONLY_WEIGHT = 0.6
#: Meaningful terms a query needs before an older copy of it leads to what that copy was told
#: (``RetrievalPipeline._expand``).  A short command sent again asks nothing an old turn answered.  Chinese terms
#: are overlapping character pairs, so "继续执行" holds three and "按你说的做" four, and three let both bring back
#: every old turn they had opened (review of 3.4.4); five is about six characters.  Of the owner's prompts over
#: two weeks, 33 of the 115 with fewer had an exact older copy; of the owner's real questions, 167 of 173 have five.
ECHO_TURN_MIN_TERMS = 5
#: SQLite virtual-machine steps between two looks at the recall's deadline while a candidate statement runs: one
#: every 10-60 ms of statement time.  Each look takes the GIL back from the statement, and beside a busy thread (the
#: MCP server's hook threads, a gateway's) waits for it: one every 10,000 steps made a 25 ms statement take 1.4 s
#: (review of 3.4.5).

_CHANNELS = ("scoped", "exact", "lexical", "claim", "recent", "vector")
#: Messages the scoped channel offers: a day of one entry, for a question that asks what was said then
#: (``recall_scope``).
SCOPED_CANDIDATES = 12
#: What a scoped candidate's fused score is multiplied by.  The question asked only what was said on its day: that
#: day's messages go before a candidate one channel found elsewhere by the question's words or the entry's name,
#: which on the shared store filled the packet ("Claude Code" is in thousands of other messages).  Three puts a
#: first rank above any candidate two channels agree on at their first rank.

        Reached as any seed's turn is, at a first rank's fixed score, it fell below every candidate two channels agreed
        on: with vectors on, the owner's questions asked again lost about 25 of 124 answers (the threshold sweep of
        2026-09-30).  Only the latest copy's turn is raised, so an answer that changed since is not raised beside the
        one that replaced it.  Of that turn at most half the packet is: the replies a channel ranked highest, which say
        what was asked, then the turn's last reply, which answers it, when the turn was read to its end.  An agent's
        turn opens with what it is about to do, and raising every reply let an old turn's first messages fill the
        packet, as raising every reply a channel found let its narration of the subject do (reviews of its first and
        second versions); the last reply read of a turn cut by the window was narration too.  Raising only the best
        found reply lost 6 of the owner's 173 questions asked again with vectors on, where more replies are found and
        the answer is not always the best of them.  They go above the best
        candidate said up to that turn, the turn's other replies included, and not above what was said after it and
        ranks higher still, which may say the answer changed.  Kept below every such candidate outranking the best of
        the turn's time, the answer fell out of the packet for 5 of the owner's 173 questions asked again: a store keeps
        growing, and something said since matches most questions (review of its second version).
