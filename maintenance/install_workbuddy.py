"""WorkBuddy host: hooks merged into WorkBuddy's own settings.json and the MCP stdio server into its mcp.json, for a
WorkBuddy attached to a shared store.

WorkBuddy has no store of its own here: ``scope-recall attach --host workbuddy`` makes its home an entry first, and
this installer only tells WorkBuddy to run the hook client of ``adapters/clients`` for it.  WorkBuddy's agent reads
command hooks from ``hooks`` in ``settings.json`` in its own home (``~/.workbuddy``).  It reads no MCP server of its
own: the desktop app starts it with ``--strict-mcp-config`` and only its connector proxy, which serves the user's
servers listed in ``mcp.json`` there, each once the user has approved it in WorkBuddy.  (``.mcp.json`` beside it is
the app's own record of that proxy, and nothing reads another server from it.)  So the target of this install is that
home, which WorkBuddy shares: no file there is the installer's own.  The install adds or updates its own entries in
those two files, keeps every other key, hook and server, and copies a file into the install's backups before changing
it; uninstall takes out its own entries only.

On Windows WorkBuddy runs a hook command through Git Bash (``bash -c``; elsewhere through ``$SHELL -c``), so every
path in the command is a double-quoted forward-slash path.  A hook's ``timeout`` is in seconds, and a prompt hook that
runs past it blocks the prompt.  The remote client (``adapters/clients/remote_client.py``) merges its own hooks and
server into the same files with the functions here.
