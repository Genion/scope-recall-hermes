#: row was never stored, and a Claude Code Stop that had counted it as waiting did not store the words either; left in
#: place, it stopped every row after it on every pass (reviews of 3.4.0rc10).  It is tried again after a minute,
#: doubling to an hour, by whichever release runs, and the tries are counted across releases: when its
