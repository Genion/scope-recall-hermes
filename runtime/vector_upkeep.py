"""Run a vector compaction when one is due, and record what it did.

Sits between the policy (``vector/compaction.py``, which knows the footprint
and the threshold) and the store (``vector.store.LanceVectorStore.compact``,
which knows LanceDB).  ``runtime/instance.py`` has the single call site, at the
start of a drain.

Why the start and not the end: on a busy instance the drain budget is usually
spent by the time the work queue is empty, so upkeep placed at the end is
upkeep that never runs.  Reserving a few seconds up front is the difference
between a guard that holds and one that only holds while the instance is idle
-- which is exactly when it is not needed.

Not responsible for: deciding the threshold, or performing the native work.
