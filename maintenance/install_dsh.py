"""dsh (DeepSeek Harness) host: a native plugin and the MCP server, as rows of dsh's home patch, for a dsh attached to a
shared store.

dsh has no store of its own here: ``scope-recall attach --host dsh`` makes its home an entry first, and this installer
tells dsh to run, for that entry, the plugin ``distribution/dsh/scope-recall/index.mjs`` (recall before a turn's first
step and capture of each turn, through the hook client of ``adapters/clients``) and the MCP stdio server (the explicit
tools).  dsh's hooks cannot capture (no turn, no reply, a compressed session log), so the plugin is the way.

dsh composes every profile from patch layers; the home layer ``$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml`` (``~/.dsh`` by default)
reaches them all and outranks the settings a profile's UI writes.  The target of this install is that home, which dsh
shares:
- the plugin file is the installer's own, at ``<home>/scope-recall/dsh-plugin/index.mjs`` (beside the patch that names
  it, in the receipt, removed by uninstall);
- the two rows go into ``cordis.patch.yml`` between markers, as one ``insert`` operation; every other line of the file
  is kept, and the file is copied into the install's backups before it changes;
- dsh uploads its session log to its model API by default, recalled memories with it.  The install writes that upload
  off (``session-log-deepseek``, ``enabled: false``) between markers of their own, which uninstall leaves in place:
  switching it on again would upload everything recorded while it was off.

The file is read with PyYAML (a dependency already) to refuse what this cannot edit safely: a file that is not a list,
a list not written as a block at column 0, rows of these ids inserted by something else, or another MCP server named
``scope-recall``.  dsh applies the operations in order, each key replacing the row's own.  So an operation that names
one of this install's rows without inserting it (``- id: scope-recall`` with ``disabled: true``) is the person's and
stays after the block, which a re-install writes where it stood and a fresh install before that operation; and the
upload counts as off only as the operations leave it, the install's own switch going after every other.
