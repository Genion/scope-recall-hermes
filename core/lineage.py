"""Evidence links and object dependencies, read and written in one place.

An object (event, claim, episode, artifact, reference) derives from source
versions (``evidence_links``) and may depend on other objects
(``object_dependencies``).  Every runtime reader and writer of those two
tables goes through here, so a rule such as "an episode's lineage sits at the
revision each source entered, and a revision reads every row at or below it"
is stated once instead of repeated in each query.  The legacy converters
(``maintenance/legacy_*``) write their own rows: they run outside a
Transaction on a target they are building.

Two queries stay where they are on purpose, because they join lineage into a
larger ranking query rather than read it: the preference match in
``core/background_context.py`` and the cited-origin lookup in
``core/candidate_tables.py``.
