"""Claude Code or Codex on another machine: forward each hook to its entry's server over HTTP.

This runs where the client runs.  It keeps no store, no model key and no memory: each hook's payload goes to
the entry's server (``remote_server``) with the entry's token, and the server's answer is the hook's answer.
A Claude Code Stop or SessionEnd also reads this machine's session record from a cursor kept here and sends
what the record shows being said (``transcript.said``); the cursor moves only as far as the server stored.

When the server cannot be reached the hook answers with nothing, so the client is held up only briefly: a
connection that has not opened in ``CONNECT_SECONDS`` is given up, and for ``AWAY_SECONDS`` after that no
hook tries.  A Claude Code session's record carries what was said to that session's next Stop that gets
through; what a session had not sent when it ended stays unsent.  A Codex hook is kept in a spool here and
sent, with the moment it happened, by the next hook that reaches the server; a full spool drops its oldest.
Requests go straight to the server, never through a proxy this machine has for the internet, which cannot
reach a private address.  What did not get through, and what the spool dropped, is logged in the state folder.
A WorkBuddy client (``host: workbuddy``) is forwarded as the claude-code host's is, its record read with
``transcript.workbuddy_said``.  WorkBuddy has no plugin here: ``install`` merges the hooks and the MCP server into
WorkBuddy's own settings.json and mcp.json (``--plugin-dir`` names WorkBuddy's home), as the local installer does,
keeping everything else in them and a copy of each file it changes under the state folder's ``backups``.

    python -m scope_recall.adapters.codex.remote_client token --config <client.json>
    python -m scope_recall.adapters.codex.remote_client install --config <client.json> --plugin-dir <dir>
    python -m scope_recall.adapters.codex.remote_client --config <client.json>        (the hook itself)
    python -m scope_recall.adapters.codex.remote_client flush --config <client.json>  (started by a hook)

``client.json`` holds ``url`` (the server, e.g. ``http://100.64.0.10:18765``), ``host`` (``claude-code``,
``codex`` or ``workbuddy``), ``token_file`` and ``state_dir``, all absolute.  The token never leaves this
machine except in the requests' ``Authorization`` header.
