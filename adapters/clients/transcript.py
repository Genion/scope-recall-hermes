"""Claude Code's session record, read for what the person and the model said on screen.

Claude Code's hooks carry the person's prompt and the model's last message of a turn, not
what the model says while it works, and a hook that cannot write when it runs gets no second
chance.  Claude Code keeps a record of every session, the ``transcript_path`` each hook is
given.  At the end of a turn the lines added since the last read are read here, and the
handler records what they show being said:

* the person's messages, typed or sent while a turn was running: only entries the record
  itself marks as the person's (``origin.kind == "human"``);
* the model's visible text, block by block, as it was shown.

Nothing else: no tool calls or results, no compaction summaries, task notifications, command
output or meta entries.  The record's layout is Claude Code's own and not a published
contract, so whatever is not recognised is skipped, never guessed at.

Where a read stopped is kept beside the entry, in ``<home>/scope-recall/transcripts``.  It is
disposable: without it the next read starts from the top, and what the store already holds is
recognised and skipped, so losing it costs time and never a duplicate.

WorkBuddy keeps a record of the same kind (``workbuddy_said``, ``workbuddy_record_path``), one
``message`` line per message: the person's (the ``<user_query>`` blocks of ``input_text``) and the
model's visible text (``output_text`` blocks).  Its other lines (reasoning, tool calls and results,
titles, snapshots) are skipped, and so is a user message WorkBuddy itself added: one marked
``providerData.isMeta``, a notice that a background task finished, or one with no ``<user_query>``
block (a command and its output, a teammate's report, a slash command's expansion).  A model message
whose words are only an error WorkBuddy showed in place of a reply (``providerData.error``) is
skipped as well.

dsh's session log is Zstandard-compressed and its hooks name no record, so its plugin keeps each
turn's messages and sends them with the Stop (``dsh_lines``), as a client on another machine sends
the lines of its own record.
